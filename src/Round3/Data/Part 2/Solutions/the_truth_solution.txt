The storm finally broke. Mass protests erupted across the city, a sea of angry faces demanding the resignation of the entire Executive Council. The streets, once bustling with the rhythm of daily life, became a battleground between the forces of the people and the remnants of the old regime. The police, initially deployed to maintain order, found themselves increasingly sympathetic to the protesters, many of whom were their own neighbors and friends.
The protests, initially peaceful, began to escalate. Acts of civil disobedience, such as roadblocks and building occupations, became commonplace. The city, once a symbol of progress and prosperity, descended into chaos. Businesses shuttered their doors, fearing for the safety of their employees. The tourist industry, a major source of revenue, ground to a halt as visitors fled the city in fear.
President Abdullah, trapped within the fortified walls of his opulent residence, watched in horror as his power crumbled. The military, long a silent observer, began to distance itself from the embattled President. Sensing the tide turning, key figures within the establishment began to defect, seeking to distance themselves from the sinking ship.
The end, when it came, was swift and decisive. President Abdullah, stripped of his power and facing overwhelming public pressure, was forced to resign. The Executive Council, its members facing a barrage of criminal charges, was disbanded. A new era dawned for the city, an era of hope and uncertainty, a time for healing and rebuilding.
